This project comes from https://gist.github.com/bric3/ce236e2c74860fd60f3aa542b5a800d0[a Java script] 
I created mid-2020 to understand native memory consumption. The Java Native Memory Tracking
wasn't enough to understand the growth of the **R**esident **S**et **S**ize of some
JVM workloads. It uses the output of `pmap` (part of the procps package), this tool
extract information from the OS `/proc` filesystem to get the system view of the process 
memory mappings.

Currently `JavaPmapInspector` script focus is to help diagnose the considerable amount of glibc 
arenas.



Contributions more than welcome.


.TODO
- Tests
- Make an actual project structure
- ...
